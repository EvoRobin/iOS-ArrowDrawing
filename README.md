# iOS-ArrowDrawing

This project demonstrates several different approaches to drawing arrows on iOS
including CoreGraphics and CoreAnimation. The app is designed to run on an
iPhone and requires at least iOS7.

The project accompanies a talk I first presented at CocoaConf in April 2014.
Once available, I'll post a link to the slides in this readme.

Grab the code and take a look at how things work. If you find any problems then
I'd love a pull request, or just raise an issue :]

cheers
